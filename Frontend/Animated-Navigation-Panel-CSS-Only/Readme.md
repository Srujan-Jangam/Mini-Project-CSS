# 🎨 Animated Navigation Panel (CSS Only)

This is a **responsive, animated sidebar navigation panel** built using **only HTML and CSS** — without any JavaScript.  
The project demonstrates how CSS transitions, positioning, and the checkbox hack can be used to create functional and smooth navigation animations.

## 🧩 Overview

### 🎯 The Purpose

To explore advanced **CSS-only UI animations** and improve layout structuring without relying on JavaScript.  
The sidebar opens and closes with a smooth animation, featuring an overlay effect and icon-based navigation links.
