## My Process

### Built With
- HTML5
- CSS3
- Flexbox

### What I Learned
This project helped me understand how to use **Flexbox** effectively for centering elements on a webpage.  
Even though I faced some challenges as a beginner, it gave me practical experience beyond just watching tutorials.  
I took guidance from ChatGPT and implemented the layout fully on my own, which helped me build real confidence in writing HTML and CSS from scratch.
