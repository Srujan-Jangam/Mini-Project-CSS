## My Process

### Built With

- Semantic **HTML5** markup
- **CSS3** custom properties
- **Flexbox** for layout
- **Mobile-first** workflow
- **Responsive design** principles
- [Google Fonts - Inter](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inter)

---

### What I Learned

This challenge helped me focus on creating clean and minimal UI using just HTML and CSS.  
Some key learnings include:

- Structuring layouts using Flexbox effectively
- Maintaining consistent spacing and color hierarchy
- Designing interactive hover states with smooth transitions

Here’s a snippet of my favorite CSS from this project:

```css
.social-links a:hover {
  background-color: hsl(75, 94%, 57%);
  color: hsl(0, 0%, 8%);
  transform: scale(1.05);
  transition: all 0.3s ease;
}
```

### Continued Development

Going forward, I want to:
- Rebuild this project using React to practice component-based structuring
- Integrate accessibility improvements (like ARIA labels and keyboard navigation)
- Experiment with Tailwind CSS to replicate the same design faster
